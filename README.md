# Zomato-Exploratory-Analysis
🍴 Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis

This project presents a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Zomato Restaurants Dataset.
The objective is to extract meaningful insights into customer preferences, restaurant performance, and geographical distribution using data-driven techniques.

Through this analysis, I demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation — essential for decision-making in the food and hospitality industry.

📈 Key Insights

🇮🇳 India dominates the dataset with the maximum number of restaurants, followed by the USA and UK.

⭐ Rating distribution:

4.5–4.9 → Excellent

4.0–4.4 → Very Good

3.5–3.9 → Good

3.0–3.4 → Average

2.5–2.9 → Below Average

⚠️ A very high number of restaurants are not rated, reflecting engagement gaps.

📊 The majority of ratings fall between 2.5 and 3.4, showing that most restaurants are perceived as average or below.

🔎 Maximum zero ratings come from Indian customers, suggesting potential biases or data quality issues.
